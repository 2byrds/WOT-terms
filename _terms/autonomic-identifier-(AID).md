## Definition

An identifier that is self-certifying and self-sovereign.

## KERI related requirements
A self-managing [cryptonym](cryptonymous)ous identifier that MUST be self-certifying (self-authenticating) and MUST be encoded in CESR as a qualified cryptographic primitive. An AID MAY exhibit other self-managing properties such as transferable control using key pre-rotation which enables control over such an AID to persist in spite of key weakness or compromise due to exposure. Authoritative control over the identifier persists in spite of the evolution of the key-state.\
