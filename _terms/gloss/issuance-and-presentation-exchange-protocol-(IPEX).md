## Definition
provides a uniform mechanism for the issuance and presentation of ACDCs in a securely attributable manner. A single protocol is able to work for both types of exchanges (issuance and presentation) by recognizing that all exchanges (both issuance and presentation) may be modeled as the disclosure of information by a Discloser to a Disclosee.\
The difference between exchange types is the information disclosed not the mechanism for disclosure.\
