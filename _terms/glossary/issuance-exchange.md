## Definition
A special case of a [presentation exchange](term_presentation-exchange) where the [Discloser](term_discloser) is the [Issuer](term_issuer) of the origin (Primary) ACDC of the [DAG](term_directed-acyclic-graph) formed by the set of chained [ACDC](term_authentic-chained-data-container)s so disclosed.

In an issuance exchange, when the origin ACDC has an [Issuee](term_issues), the [Disclosee](term_disclosee) MAY also be the origin ACDC's Issuee.
