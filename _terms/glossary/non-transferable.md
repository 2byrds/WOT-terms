## Definition
Controlling keys over this identifier cannot be rotated and therefore this identifier is non-transferable to other control.\

## KERI related

The KERI design approach is to build composable primitives instead of custom functionality that is so typical of other DKMI approaches:

- [transferable identifiers](term_transferable-identifier)
- non-transferable identifiers
- [delegated identifiers](term_delegated-identifier)
