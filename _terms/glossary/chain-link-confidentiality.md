## Definition
chains together a sequence of [Disclosees](disclosees). Each Disclosee in the sequence in turn is the [Discloser](discloser) to the next Disclosee.

## Contrast
Disclosures via [Presentations Exchanges](presentation-exchanges) may be contractually protected by Chain-Link Confidentiality (i.e. a Chain-Link Confidential disclosure). The chaining in this case is different from the chaining described above between Issuances in a [DAG](directed-acyclic-graph) of chained Issuances. Chain-link confidentiality, in contrast, chains together a sequence of Disclosees.\
