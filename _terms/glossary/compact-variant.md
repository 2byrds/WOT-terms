## Definition
an [Issuer](term_issuer) commitment via a signature to any variant of ACDC (compact, full, etc) makes a cryptographic commitment to the top-level section fields shared by all variants of that ACDC because the value of a [top level section field](term_top-level-section) is either the [SAD](term_SAD) or the [SAID](term_SAID) of the SAD of the associated section.

## Relation
All the variants of an [ACDC](term_authentic-chained-data-container) are various degrees of expansion of the compact variant.\
