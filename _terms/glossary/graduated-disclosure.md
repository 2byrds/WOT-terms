## Definition
disclosure performed by a presentation exchange that has cross-variant (see [compact variant](term_compact-variant)) Issuer commitment verifiability as an essential property. It supports graduated disclosure by the [Disclosee](term_disclosee) of any or all variants wether it be full, compact, metadata, partial, selective, bulk issued, or contractually protected.\
Paraphrased by @henkvancann based on [source](https://github.com/WebOfTrust/ietf-ipex/blob/main/draft-ssmith-ipex.md#discussion)

## Reuse
The [SAID](term_SAID) of a given variant is useful even when it is not the SAID of the variant the [Issuer](term_issuer) signed because during graduated disclosure the [Discloser](term_discloser) MAY choose to sign that given variant to fulfil a given step in an IPEX graduated disclosure transaction. 

## Rule
The disclosure performed by a presentation exchange MAY be [graduated](term_graduated-disclosure) and MAY be [contractually](term_contractually-protected-disclosure) protected.
