## Definition
Internal is used to describe things that exist or happen inside an entity. In our scope of digital identifiers its (in)consistency is considered within the defining data structures and related data stores.

In KERI we are protected against internal inconsistency by the hash chain datastructure of the `KEL`, because the only authority that can sign the log is the controller itself.
