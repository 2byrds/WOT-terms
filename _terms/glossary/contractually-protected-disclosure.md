Paraphrased by @henkvancann based on [source](https://github.com/WebOfTrust/ietf-ipex/blob/main/draft-ssmith-ipex.md#discussion)

## Relation
This [IPEX](term_IPEX) protocol leverages important features of [ACDC](term_acdc)s and ancillary protocols such as [CESR](term_CESR), [SAID](term_SAID)s, and [CESR-Proofs](term_cesr-proof) as well as [Ricardian contract](term_ricardian-contract)s and graduated disclosure (partial, selective, full) to enable contractually protected disclosure. Contractually protected disclosure includes both [chain-link confidential](term_chain-link confidential) and [contingent disclosure](term_contingent disclosure).

## Rule
The disclosure performed by a presentation exchange MAY be [graduated](term_graduated-disclosure) and MAY be [contractually](term_contractually-protected-disclosure) protected.
