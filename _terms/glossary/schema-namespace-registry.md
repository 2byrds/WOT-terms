## Definition

a centrally managed [schema registry](term_schema-registry) where corporations or individuals reserve schemas within a specific [namespace](term_namespace) in order to have an interoperable schema that is labeled with a corporation-specific or individual-specific namespace. 

## ACDC related
[Graphs](term_graph) in ACDC have decentralised the old-school schema registry, so it's [interoperable](term_interoperability) by design.
