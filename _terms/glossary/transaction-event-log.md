## Definition
The set of transactions that determine registry state form a log called a Transaction Event Log (TEL). The TEL provides a cryptographic proof of registry state by reference to the corresponding controlling KEL. Any validator may therefore cryptographically verify the authoritative state of the registry.

### Put differently
An externally anchored transactions log via cryptographic commitments in a KEL.

So KERI introduces for the first time many entirely new innovative concepts that are derived from many well known concepts. 
Each new invention is by itself worthy of its own white paper.\
This results in new terminology. Some are entirely new words used in entirely new ways. Others are adaptations of existing
terms but defined more precisiely for the KERI innovative use.
