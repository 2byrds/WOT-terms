## Definition
Encoding protocol that is composable in a hierarchy and enables pipelining (multiplexing and de-multiplexing) of complex streams in either text or compact binary. This allows management at scale for high-bandwidth applications.

## Example 
{TBW prio2}

## CESR related
Because of [count codes](term_count-code) and the [composability](term_composability) - and [concatenation](term_concatenation) property in CESR, [pipelining](term_pipelining) is possible, which then uses [multiplexing](term_multiplexing) (combining [self-framing](term_self-framing) primitives) and _de-multiplexing_ (unravelling self-framing [primitives](term_primitives)).
