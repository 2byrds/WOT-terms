## KERI related

The KERI design approach is to build composable primitives instead of custom functionality that is so typical of other DKMI approaches:

- transferable identifiers
- [non-transferable identifiers](term_non-transferable-identifier)
- [delegated identifiers](term_delegated-identifier)
