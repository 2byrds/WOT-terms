## Definition
is a form of a _Verifiable Data Registry_ that tracks the issuance/revocation state of credentials issued by the controller of the KEL. 

Two types of TELs will be used for this purpose. The first type of TEL is the _management TEL_ and will signal the creation of the Registry and track the list of Registrars that will act as Backers for the individual TELs for each VC. The second type of TEL is the _VC TEL_ which will track the issued or revoked state of each VC and will contain a reference to it's corresponding management TEL.
