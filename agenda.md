### Discussion items

### 2022-08-11

Present:

Kent Bull\
Steven Milstein\
Petteri from Ubisecure\
Henk van Cann (host)

Comments about minutes July 28? No input, so July 28 fixed.

- Recording: {no recording made}

- Agenda\
 20 minutes - [concepts](https://github.com/WebOfTrust/WOT-terms/blob/main/concepts.md) & terms\
 20 minutes - use cases (meters-narrative: objective measuring, license plates-narrative: counterfeit obvious?:  , ...)\
 10 minutes - Q&A
 
 - Minutes\
 `Steven` stresses his focus on the actual Markdown.\
 `Kent` would like to document the difference between the white paper and the current state of KERI code\
 `Kent` offers to take CESROX down the path of what the [concepts](https://github.com/WebOfTrust/WOT-terms/blob/main/concepts.md) file intends.\
 `Kent/Steven` would want to list the major "decentralised identity" projects (inside and outside ToIP / IETF context); resulting in a mindmap for usecases of our own KERI/ACDC proposition to offer context.\
 15:18:40 From Steven Milstein to Everyone:\
	Example Mind map in markdown https://hackmd.io/@stevenmilstein/SkCKy9fC9\
 An example use case generator for KERI/ACDC would be 'Centralised won't work!", so then we HAVE TO move over from old way of thinking and creating systems to the new ones available.\
  `Petteri` would like to see 'Abstractions' in our documentation, "I don't need to understand everything of GLEIF and vLEI, just the essence"

#### Concepts.md file walk-through
15:16:40 From Henk van Cann to Everyone:
	https://hackmd.io/TYKEsJ5OQy-4w78NUGRSMA?view ; here is where you could amend the content, I'm able to push the result to the WebofTrust WOT-terms repo. It's also possible to offer a PR (pull request).

15:31:48 From Henk van Cann to Everyone:
	@steven : https://github.com/trustoverip/acdc/wiki this your KISS link to the actual MarkDown?\
    
Mind you, there is no global search available there. But here [in the resulting static site](https://trustoverip.github.io/acdc/glossary ): it is possible! you could search & find “{TBW prio ..}“, To Be Written it means, and then use the links to go to the right wiki-item to amend to my definition.

#### Discussion and change of agenda for the next meeting(s)
There was pretty soon consensus about the argumentation that someone brought up that: 
1. we must document the GLEIF use case very well. All eye will be on that and Google needs to resolve at our documentation.
2. We should attract other programmers to the project by showing a convincing roadmap and the delta between (the state of) Whitepapers, the state of technical design papers and the actual code in various branches and it's also important to have direct links to them.

The current agenda items are suitable for offline processsing:
- concepts and terms: the tools are there to amend, feel free to do it
- more usecases, less focus. We have our minds and hands full on GLEIF.


### 2022-07-28

Present:\
Philip Feairheller (co-host)\
Henk van Cann (host)\
Kent Bull\
Steven Milstein\
Joseph Hunsaker\
Mijo Kaliger\
Michal Pietrus

- Recording {no recording made}

- Agenda
  1. Why are we doing the Terms & Edu call?
  2. What are the main sources of info / concepts / terms currently for KERI/ACDC
  3. How to sync glossaries with the outside world, a proposal
  4. How to set up KERI/ACDC education at various levels of understanding.

- Minutes\
  Skipped round of intros, but asked for personal motivation to join the Zoom meeting:\
  `Steven` misses the foundational work to structure the KERI and ACDC terminology: "It's a blur full of acronyms, I would like to change this"\
  `Kent` sees SSI in general and KERI/ACDC in particulier being able to change the current power dynamics (e.g. CBDC, central bank digital currencies) for the good: control over your identifiers. "I'd like to do this via strictly open source development on one hand and the development of courses as a commercial activity on the other"\
  `Joseph`'s preference is top down approach, but minimalistic. He sees Use cases as the most important stepping stone to a sophisticated Terminology base, "and from this custom made towards target groups."\
  `Philip` stresses the importance of getting the word out. "We've been working heads done to get the code ready, now it's time to document it properly"\
  `Mijo` is in de provenance team and working with on Kimi the mobile interface. That's his perspective, he recognizes the jungle of wording Steven pointed out and want to learn what KERI and ACDC is all about.\
  `Henk` presented his personal motivation during the presentation.

#### Presentation

[Google slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Aqj8GkiLLo2bvwJK_9wU3h_1vGtYVU5zKe4KjFQ-Ga4/edit#slide=id.g13fad489b5e_0_175) meant to introduce three of four agenda items (1,3 and 4).

Main take away: What `Henk` would like participants to do is 
> think about what's important to you
> as far as adoption of KERI/ACDC is concerned
Our target groups apart from the KERI/ACDC development teams, are:
1. The participants of this Zoom meeting series
2. People working for Foundations like ToIP, eSSIF and DIF
3. SSI Experts
4. Experts working in the security and Identity field

`Henk` suggest to explicitely not target the outside world (family, friends, etc) to try and convince, because that'll be another level of complexity to achieve?

#### Get the content out

`Steven` strongly advices from his experience (with analysis paralysis) to:
1. Keep the .md harvesting manual, simple and get the content out.
`Joseph` adds:
2. Describe credible use cases and 
3. derive target groups from use cases, not the other way around.

As dicussion evolved during the meeting, we've changed this to *usecase-based* way (the voting example and the 'I control my data' narrative; by `Kent`) of thinking and to keep it *very practical and simple*.\
We need appealing narratives.

One idea was to OCR one or both presentations of `Philip` that have been recorded. 
- [Phil's demo](https://onedrive.live.com/?authkey=%21AMjKofNCEMxYC10&cid=67133A6AC26E649A&id=67133A6AC26E649A%21118&parId=root&o=OneUp)
- {the other one is??}

`Steven` express his wish for easy to use Developer-tooling CLI, and Docker containers to able to demonstrate KERI/ACDC to others. `Philip` says the status of the currently outdated Docker container of *Keripy* and *Keep*: 'to be updated soon'.

The meeting concluded with the structure of the future agenda (by `Philip`): time-slot based, and addressing the topics list under the [new agenda](./2022-08-11) for the next meeting.
