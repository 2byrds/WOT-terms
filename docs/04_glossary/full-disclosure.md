## Definition
A disclosure of data in all its details.

When used in the context of [selective disclosure](selective-disclosure.md), full disclosure means _detailed disclosure of the selectively disclosed attributes_ not detailed disclosure of all selectively disclosable attributes. Whereas when used in the context of [partial disclosure](partial-disclosure.md), full disclosure means _detailed disclosure of the [field map](field-map.md)_ that was so far only partially disclosed.
