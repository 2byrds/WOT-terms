## Definition

Encoding protocol that is composable in a hierarchy and enables pipelining (multiplexing and de-multiplexing) of complex streams in either text or compact binary. This allows management at scale for high-bandwidth applications.

## Example

{TBW prio2}

## CESR related

Because of [count codes](count-code.md) and the [composability](composability.md) - and [concatenation](concatenation.md) property in CESR, [pipelining](pipelining.md) is possible, which then uses [multiplexing](multiplexing.md) (combining [self-framing](self-framing.md) primitives) and _de-multiplexing_ (unravelling self-framing [primitives](primitives.md)).
