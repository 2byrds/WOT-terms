## Definition

A special case of a [presentation exchange](presentation-exchange.md) where the [Discloser](discloser.md) is the [Issuer](issuer.md) of the origin (Primary) ACDC of the [DAG](directed-acyclic-graph.md) formed by the set of chained [ACDC](authentic-chained-data-container.md)s so disclosed.

In an issuance exchange, when the origin ACDC has an [Issuee](issues.md), the [Disclosee](disclosee.md) MAY also be the origin ACDC's Issuee.
