# Cheat sheet: writing a page inside `/doc`

A few simple rules about headings, internal linking, images and more.

Everything that is important to do the right way but you keep forgetting how to do it.


<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">

## Strongly recommended

Use an editor that fixes markdown links when changing file names or moving files. We recommend * Visual Studio Code * (https://code.visualstudio.com).

* Go to preferences
* Type in search field: “markdown link update”
* Set to “prompt” or “always”

(This video explains: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hcN0yfOAzQ)

</div>

## Headings

Start a page with a `#` followed by a space.

(If you start with a `##` then Docusaurus will ad a `#` based on the file name. Not desirable.)

Example:

`# Main title`

This will result in a `<h1>` in the final html after the Markdown is parsed.

Add structure to your document by adding `<h2>`, in Markdown a `##` followed by a space.

Example:

```
# Main title

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

## Subtitle 1

Sed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error sit voluptatem accusantium doloremque laudantium

## Subtitle 2

Nemo enim ipsam voluptatem quia voluptas sit aspernatur aut odit aut fugit.

```

## Internal linking in the `docs` section


<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">

### Warnings

* Unlike a CMS like Wordpress, Docusaurus is file based. Renaming a file means that a link to this file no longer works if the file name is not also changed inside the link.

* After renaming a file or directory you will have to restart the localserver to take effect. Also it is recommended to use an incognito browser to avoid caching issues. (And even then it looks like sometimes it may take while before links start to work.)

</div>

### From page to page

Internal linking is not easy in most content management systems. In Docusaurus it's difficult to keep all links working after renaming files. Here you will find best practise.

General rule: use relative links, and use the `.md` extension at the end.

Let's take this file system:

```
├── concepts
│   ├── concepts.md
│   └── keri-dev-env.md
├── education
│   ├── intro.md
```

To create a link inside education/intro.md TO concepts/concepts.md write the following:

```
[Link to concepts](../concepts/concepts.md)
```

If you do it this way, you can make Visual Studio Code [work for you](#strongly-recommended) and update the links if you move or rename files.

There are more ways to create links, read about it on https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/links, but this is how we do it here.

### In the same page (anchor)

To create a link to an anchor in the same page:

```
[anchor link inside the same page](#foo)
```

### To an anchor in another page

```
[Link to concepts](../concepts/concepts.md#foo)
```

## Inserting and styling images

### How to style images

Images are styled via CSS.

The following classes are available for styling:

```
.inline-thumb-start,
.inline-thumb-end,
.inline-small-start,
.inline-small-end,
.inline-medium-start,
.inline-medium-end,
```

Start means “to the left” (in left-to-right languages).

When no class is added the image will be 100% width.

There are two ways for styling images:

#### Add a class to the image

Use this when the image code is normal HTML.

Apply the classes by adding the class to the image. Note: do it like this. Example:

```
<img className="inline-thumb-start" src="…" alt="…">
```

Do not use ```class``` like in regular HTML, instead use ```className```.

#### Wrap the image in a div with a class

Use this when the image is added via Markdown code. Example:

```
<div className="inline-small-start">

[![foo](https://example.com/foo/bar)](https://example.com/foo/bar)

</div>
```

### How to link to the image

## Naming conventions

### Files and Directories

Use 
* [kebab-case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naming_convention_(programming)#Delimiter-separated_words)
* all lower case

This is how it is done in a default Docusaurus install.


Examples: 

Directory: `tutorial-basics`

File: `create-a-page.md`

Combined: `tutorial-basics/create-a-page.md`

### Media (images, video etc)

No conventions (yet), except one:
* remove spaces and replace with dash, underscore or nothing.

## Sidebar Menu

### Ordering

The sidebar menu is autogenerated and sorted alphanumerically.

```
├── concepts
│   ├── concepts.md
│   └── keri-dev-env.md
├── education
│   ├── intro.md
```

The directories “concepts” and “education” are called “categories” in Docusaurus. To give them a custom order, do as follows:

```
├── 02_concepts
│   ├── concepts.md
│   └── keri-dev-env.md
├── 01_education
│   ├── intro.md
```

As a bonus effect, the Visual Studio File Explorer will rearrange the directories, so will other systems like MacOS Finder etc. It is simple, effective (and intuitive for most people).


The `01_` and `02_` are removed and not visible in the browser. Renumbering will change paths in internal links but Visual Studio Code will fix these paths for you if you [have configured it to do so](#strongly-recommended).
