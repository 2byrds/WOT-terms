# Naming conventions

## Files and Directories

Use 
* [kebab-case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naming_convention_(programming)#Delimiter-separated_words)
* all lower case

This is how it is done in a default Docusaurus install.


Examples: 

Directory: `tutorial-basics`

File: `create-a-page.md`

Combined: `tutorial-basics/create-a-page.md`
