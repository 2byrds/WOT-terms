## Definition

disclosure performed by a presentation exchange that has cross-variant (see [compact variant](compact-variant.md)) Issuer commitment verifiability as an essential property. It supports graduated disclosure by the [Disclosee](disclosee.md) of any or all variants wether it be full, compact, metadata, partial, selective, bulk issued, or contractually protected.\
Paraphrased by @henkvancann based on [source](https://github.com/WebOfTrust/ietf-ipex/blob/main/draft-ssmith-ipex.md#discussion)

## Reuse

The [SAID](SAID.md) of a given variant is useful even when it is not the SAID of the variant the [Issuer](issuer.md) signed because during graduated disclosure the [Discloser](discloser.md) MAY choose to sign that given variant to fulfil a given step in an IPEX graduated disclosure transaction.

## Rule

The disclosure performed by a presentation exchange MAY be [graduated](graduated-disclosure.md) and MAY be [contractually](contractually-protected-disclosure.md) protected.
