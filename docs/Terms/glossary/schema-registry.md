## Comparison and explanation

[Syntio](https://www.syntio.net/en/labs-musings/schema-registry-comparison/) comparison of (old-school?) centralized schema registries.

This source has conceptual explanations in diagrams like the one below and code examples. However, **be aware that ACDC solves this in a different way** with [KERI-based verifiable data structures](VDS.md) and [graph fragments](graph-fragment.md).
