## Definition

The (exclusive) right to rotate the authoritative key pair and establish changed control authority.

## Relation to rotation authority

The original controller of an [AID](autonomic-identifier.md) can hold exclusive rotation authority. Because control authority is split between two key sets, the first for [signing authority](signing-authority.md) and the second ([pre-rotated](pre-rotation.md)) for rotation authority, the associated thresholds and key list can be structured in such a way that a designated [custodial agent](custodial-agent.md) can hold signing authority while the original controller can hold exclusive rotation authority.
