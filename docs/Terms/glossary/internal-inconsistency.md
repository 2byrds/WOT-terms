## Definition

Internal is used to describe things that exist or happen inside an [entity](entity.md). In our scope of digital [identifiers](identifier.md) its (in)consistency is considered within the defining data structures and related data stores.

In [KERI](key-event-receipt-infrastructure.md) we are protected against internal inconsistency by the hash chain datastructure of the [KEL](key-event-log.md), because the only [authority](authority.md) that can sign the log is the [controller](controller.md) itself.
