## Definition

The set of transactions that determine registry state form a log called a Transaction Event Log (TEL). The TEL provides a cryptographic proof of registry state by reference to the corresponding controlling [KEL](key-event-log.md). Any validator may therefore cryptographically verify the [authoritative state](authoritative.md) of the [registry](registry.md).

### Put differently

An externally anchored transactions log via cryptographic commitments in a KEL.
