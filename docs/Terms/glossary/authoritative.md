## Four Aâ€™s of secure data control

1. Author: creator, [source-of-truth](source-of-truth.md)
2. Authentic: provable origin, [root-of-trust](root-of-trust.md)
3. Authorized: consent, [loci-of-control](loci-of-control.md)
4. **Authoritative: accurate, reputable**

"A4" data control securely is established via [self-certifying](self-certifying-dentifier.md) [pseudonymous](pseudonymous.md) identifiers\
