# Policy

See the documents in this repo titled [LICENSE.md](https://github.com/WebOfTrust/Keri/blob/main/LICENSE.md) and [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/WebOfTrust/Keri/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for licensing and contributing policy. Besides the IETF licensing terms, these include the comprehensive Apache2 license for all associated intellectual property (IP) including patents. The advantage of one comprehensive license for all contributions is that there will always be alignment between all contributors and for any type of contribution. This alignment includes an **inbound=outbound** [policy](https://opensource.guide/legal/) for all related IP. We only want contributions to KERI made here in the WebOfTrust project that are licensed as free, and [nonreciprocal](https://opensource.org/node/875) open source be it software or specification.

# Meetings

We meet every other Thursday at 10 am EDT (or EST). (First meeting 2022 July 28)

The meeting agenda may be found [here](https://github.com/WebOfTrust/WOT-terms/blob/main/agenda.md). The zoom link is also at the top of the agenda page.

# Related Meetings

Our Terms and Education meeting is at the intersection Technical and Conceptual meetings. For KERI, CESR, OOBI and ACDC it's especially important to explain our concepts to the outside world because it's new and complex matter.

# Technical

ACDC leverages KERI. The [ACDC Task Force meeting](https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/ACDC+%28Authentic+Chained+Data+Container%29+Task+Force) is hosted at ToIP and meets on the alternate weeks at the same time as the [KERI meetings](https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keri/blob/main/agenda.md). The ACDC meetings complement the KERI meetings. Both meetings are focussed on technicalities, specifications and code developments.

# Conceptual

There also is the [Concepts and terminology](https://wiki.trustoverip.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=65700) of Trust over IP. It's a meeting that aligns Trust over IP (North America) and eSSIF (Europe) efforts in getting understood: concepts, terminology and glossaries and importantly being able to use and reference each others work.
