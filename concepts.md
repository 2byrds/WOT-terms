Explanation of concepts 

Concepts uses existing terms (which could create confusion) and introduces new terminology. It's aimed at identity experts in general and Self-Sovereign Identity experts specifically.

### Familiar terms

We explain the terminology at various [levels of understanding](#levels-of-understanding), and also **our criteria** how we judge certain terms to be defined for the sake of KERI / ACDC. E.g. `multisignatures`, `validators` and `verifiers`. What are they exactly? 

### Use cases and domains

Understanding could vary in different domains and use-cases (e.g. a controller in finance is quite different from a controller of an identifier). We need to be sure that sender and recipient are talking about the same thing.

### New terminology, acronyms and abbreviations

KERI is a totally different beast. So inevitably new terminology surfaces in the process of designing KERI and ACDC. In this concepts page we try to explain them in few levels of understanding and using analogies to and symbols in the world the newbie identity expert

## Concepts

### Security first, then confidentiality, then privacy
### Strong bindings - security first
### Verifiable to the root of trust
### Primary root of trust - sufficient entropy / randomness + Private keys need to be kept private
### Portability - no anchoring to silos
### Secondary root-of-trust - non-portable anchoring to blockchains as an extra layer of guarantee (above KELs)
### Internal consistency (VDS) and external consistency
### Ambient verifiability
### Its and Bits - Cryptography and one-way functions is the only thing than can safe our digital twin
### Network dynamics - centralised system will lose
### Moore’s law in IoT - centralised systems not capable of 
### Anonymity is non-existing anymore - second best is expensive and timely pseudonymity
### Duplicity - Don’t trust unique identifiers with multiple states per default
### Reconciliation - use consensus mechanism to try to recover from duplicity

### Content addressable hashes - uniqueness - finding - unchanged
### First seen - timing solution - overload protection
 
### Pre-rotation - quantum protection - security fallback (exposure, theft) - portray changing power dynamics
### Rotation - control authority without transaction
### Freedom of witness and backer organisation
### Freedom of validator and watchtower organisation
### Private keys need to be kept private
### Delegation - non-custodial - always staying in control
